# Innovative Online Retail Store

This project is an advanced, modular online retail platform built with a Django RESTful backend and a modern React front end. The application is designed to be scalable, configurable, and ready for future enhancements such as AI-powered recommendations, real-time notifications, and secure payment integration.

## Features

- **Product Management:** CRUD operations for products with details such as price, stock, category, and ratings.
- **AI-Based Recommendations:** A dummy recommendation endpoint that can later be enhanced with a machine-learning model.
- **Order Processing:** Manage orders and order items with status tracking.
- **User Registration:** Basic user registration using Djangoâ€™s built-in User model.
- **RESTful API:** All operations are exposed as RESTful endpoints.
- **Modern Front End:** A responsive React application with a navigation bar, product listing, and user registration form.
- **Configurable:** Sensitive settings are managed through a dedicated `config.py` file (for the backend), which is not committed to version control.
